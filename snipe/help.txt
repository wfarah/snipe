 SNIPE (Signal-to-Noise Investigation of Pulsed Events)
 ======================================================
 This graphical interface allows users to:
 - Load a filterbank file
 - Dedisperse the data
 - Manually remove RFI
 - Average in time and frequency
 - Calculate SNR using selected signal and noise regions
 
 SNR Calculation
 ===============
 1. Select the 'Signal' Region:
    - Hover over the timeseries plot and press 's'.
    - Click twice to mark the range where the signal is present.
    - Only one signal region can be selected.
 
 2. Select the 'Noise' Region:
    - Hover over the timeseries plot and press 'n'.
    - Click twice to define the noise region.
    - Multiple noise regions can be selected.
 
 3. Calculate SNR:
    - Click the 'Calculate SNR' button or press 'c'.
 
 4. Reset Selections:
    - Hover over the timeseries plot and press 'r' to reset.
 
 RFI Zapping
 ===========
 1. Remove Frequency Channels:
    - Hover over the waterfall plot and press 'f'.
    - Click twice to select the frequency range to remove.
 
 2. Remove Time Samples:
    - Hover over the waterfall plot and press 't'.
    - Click twice to select the time range to remove.
 
 3. Zap a Single Time Sample:
    - Hover over the specific pixel in the waterfall plot.
    - Press 'z' to remove it.
    - You can also hold 'z' while moving the cursor 
      to zap multiple pixels (can be a bit slow)
 
 4. Reset RFI Zapping:
    - Press 'r' to restore all removed data.
 
 Notes
 =====
 - Ensure you hover over the correct plot before making selections.
 - Use 'r' to reset selections for both SNR calculation and RFI zapping.
 - You can use the zoom in/out navigation tools freely
